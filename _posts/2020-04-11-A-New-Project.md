# A New Project

I was watching a lecture from the Stanford CS230 course and  Professor Andrew's words on need of  implementing papers and making projects really motivated me. To make sure that this motivation does not disappear the following day, I am making this blog post with the intention of holding myself accountable. 

I have decided to implement the paper [Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks](https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/papers/zeilerECCV2014.pdf). The project will have two major phases:

- [ ] The first part will consist of trying to replicate the visualisations of various layers of the network similar to the paper on static images.
- [ ] The second part will be implement a system that will run this operation on live video.
- [ ] (Optional) This will include the implementation of an Android app that shows activation for something like a face using TF-Lite.
